# Recital
Generate possible programs for a dance recital.  The input consists of a set of dance sequences, each composed of one or more dances.  A dance is represented by a set of dancers.

A valid program for a recital consists of a sequence (list) of dance sequences which are arranged so that the order of dances in each specified sequence is preserved, but so that no dancer appears in two consecutive dances except possibly within one of the input sequences.
